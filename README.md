# Design Tools
A long time, I design prototype in photoshop, it's helpful, but i have problems when convert from psd to App, it's not hard, but it spent many 
time of me. And i don't t know create animation in photoshop.

2 days ago, I found Sketch, and try it. After try it, bye bye photoshop.ðŸ˜­

**Sketch**, my new friend in design tools. I had learned 2 days ago, it's amazing, easy learning, and you should learn it instead learn Photoshop
 
**Flinto** convert prototype in Sketch to animation preview. Before start code in react native, you need design a transition for `Scence`, you can caculator timing duration, position easy, and you should do it, your app will be wonderful animation.
 
**Zeplin** It help you convert from idea design to App. It's easy export image, get distance from other component, get CSS, and more, ...

You should learn it ðŸ˜˜
